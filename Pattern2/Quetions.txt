B. Fence
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
There is a fence in front of Polycarpus's home. The fence consists of n planks of the same width which go one after another from left to right. The height of the i-th plank is hi meters, distinct planks can have distinct heights.

Fence for n = 7 and h = [1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 7, 1]
Polycarpus has bought a posh piano and is thinking about how to get it into the house. In order to carry out his plan, he needs to take exactly k consecutive planks from the fence. Higher planks are harder to tear off the fence, so Polycarpus wants to find such k consecutive planks that the sum of their heights is minimal possible.
Write the program that finds the indexes of k consecutive planks with minimal total height. Pay attention, the fence is not around Polycarpus's home, it is in front of home (in other words, the fence isn't cyclic).

Input
The first line of the input contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1.5·105, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of planks in the fence and the width of the hole for the piano. The second line contains the sequence of integers h1, h2, ..., hn (1 ≤ hi ≤ 100), where hi is the height of the i-th plank of the fence.

Output
Print such integer j that the sum of the heights of planks j, j + 1, ..., j + k - 1 is the minimum possible. If there are multiple such j's, print any of them.

B. Present from Lena
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Vasya's birthday is approaching and Lena decided to sew a patterned handkerchief to him as a present. Lena chose digits from 0 to n as the pattern. The digits will form a rhombus. The largest digit n should be located in the centre. The digits should decrease as they approach the edges. For example, for n = 5 the handkerchief pattern should look like that:


          0
        0 1 0
      0 1 2 1 0
    0 1 2 3 2 1 0
  0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
  0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 0
    0 1 2 3 2 1 0
      0 1 2 1 0
        0 1 0
          0
Your task is to determine the way the handkerchief will look like by the given n.

Input
The first line contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 9).

Output
Print a picture for the given n. You should strictly observe the number of spaces before the first digit on each line. Every two adjacent digits in the same line should be separated by exactly one space. There should be no spaces after the last digit at the end of each line.

3) A. Favorite Sequence
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Polycarp has a favorite sequence $$$a[1 \dots n]$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:

he wrote the number $$$a_1$$$ to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);
he wrote the number $$$a_2$$$ to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard);
then as far to the left as possible (but to the right from $$$a_1$$$), he wrote the number $$$a_3$$$;
then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from $$$a_2$$$), he wrote the number $$$a_4$$$;
Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard.
The beginning of the result looks like this (of course, if $$$n \ge 4$$$).
For example, if $$$n=7$$$ and $$$a=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]$$$, then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard $$$[3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 1]$$$.

You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence.

Input
The first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 300$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 300$$$) — the length of the sequence written on the whiteboard.

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2,\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$) — the sequence written on the whiteboard.

Output
Output $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases. Each answer — is a sequence $$$a$$$ that Polycarp wrote out on the whiteboard.

C. Vasya and String - (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/676/C)
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
High school student Vasya got a string of length n as a birthday present. This string consists of letters 'a' and 'b' only. Vasya denotes beauty of the string as the maximum length of a substring (consecutive subsequence) consisting of equal letters.

Vasya can change no more than k characters of the original string. What is the maximum beauty of the string he can achieve?

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the length of the string and the maximum number of characters to change.
The second line contains the string, consisting of letters 'a' and 'b' only.

Output
Print the only integer — the maximum beauty of the string Vasya can achieve by changing no more than k characters.

Note
In the first sample, Vasya can obtain both strings "aaaa" and "bbbb".
In the second sample, the optimal answer is obtained with the string "aaaaabaa" or with the string "aabaaaaa".
